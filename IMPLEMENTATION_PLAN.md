gem "vcr"            # Record API interactions
```

#### 1.2 TDD Workflow for Each Feature

**Every feature follows this TDD cycle:**
1. **Write failing spec first**
2. **Implement minimal code to pass**
3. **Refactor with confidence**
4. **Ensure 90%+ test coverage**

### Phase 2: Core Models with TDD (Week 1-2)

#### 2.1 Test-First Model Development

```ruby
# Start with specs for each model:

# spec/models/profile_spec.rb
RSpec.describe Profile do
  it { should belong_to(:user) }
  it { should validate_presence_of(:first_name) }
  it { should define_enum_for(:role).with_values(tenant: 0, landlord: 1, agent: 2, admin: 3) }
  # Write ALL specs before implementing model
end

# spec/models/listing_spec.rb
RSpec.describe Listing do
  it { should belong_to(:property) }
  it { should have_many(:bookings) }
  it { should define_enum_for(:listing_type).with_values(rent: 0, sale: 1, short_term: 2) }
  it { should monetize(:price) }
  # Complete spec suite first
end
```

**Models to implement (TDD):**
- ‚úÖ `Profile` - Extended user information
- ‚úÖ `Listing` - Property listings with pricing
- `Booking` - Reservation system
- `Payment` - Transaction records
- `Review` - Rating system
- `Message` - Communication (with ActionCable)
- `Verification` - Document verification
- `AuditLog` - Compliance tracking
- `AIEmbedding` - pgvector for recommendations
- `Amenity` - Property features
- `ListingAmenity` - Join table

### Phase 3: Service Objects with TDD (Week 2-3)

#### 3.1 Test-First Service Architecture

```ruby
# spec/services/property/search_service_spec.rb
RSpec.describe Property::SearchService do
  describe '#call' do
    context 'with location filters' do
      it 'returns properties within radius'
      it 'orders by distance'
      it 'applies price filters'
    end

    context 'with AI recommendations' do
      it 'uses pgvector for similarity search'
      it 'personalizes based on user history'
    end
  end
end
```

**Service Objects (all TDD):**
```
app/services/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recommendation_service.rb (with pgvector)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ embedding_generator.rb
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fraud_detector.rb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ property/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ search_service.rb (PostgreSQL full-text)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ valuation_service.rb
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ verification_service.rb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payment/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payment_processor.rb (using Pay gem)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subscription_manager.rb
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notification/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notifier.rb (Solid Queue jobs)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ broadcaster.rb (Solid Cable)
```

### Phase 4: Background Jobs with Solid Queue (Week 3)

#### 4.1 TDD for Background Jobs

```ruby
# spec/jobs/property_indexing_job_spec.rb
RSpec.describe PropertyIndexingJob do
  it 'generates AI embeddings' do
    property = create(:property)

    expect {
      described_class.perform_now(property.id)
    }.to change { property.reload.embedding_vector }.from(nil)
  end

  it 'updates search index' do
    # Test PostgreSQL full-text search index update
  end
end
```

**Solid Queue Jobs (all TDD):**
- `PropertyIndexingJob` - Generate embeddings & search index

RSpec.describe PropertyChannel do
  it "subscribes to property updates"
  it "broadcasts price changes"
  it "handles availability updates"
end

# spec/system/real_time_chat_spec.rb
RSpec.describe "Real-time Chat", type: :system do
  it "delivers messages instantly via Solid Cable"
  it "shows typing indicators"
  it "handles presence tracking"
end
```

### Phase 7: AI/ML Features with TDD (Week 6)

#### 7.1 Test-First AI Integration

```ruby
# spec/services/ai/recommendation_service_spec.rb
RSpec.describe AI::RecommendationService do
  describe '#generate_recommendations' do
    before do
      # Use VCR to record OpenAI API calls
      VCR.use_cassette('openai_recommendations')
    end

    it 'generates property embeddings using OpenAI'
    it 'stores vectors in PostgreSQL using neighbor gem'
    it 'finds similar properties using cosine similarity'
    it 'personalizes based on user preferences'
  end
end
```

### Phase 8: Performance & Caching with TDD (Week 7)

#### 8.1 Solid Cache Testing

```ruby
# spec/services/cache_service_spec.rb
RSpec.describe CacheService do
  it "caches expensive queries with Solid Cache"
  it "invalidates cache on updates"
  it "handles cache stampedes"

  describe 'performance' do
    it 'serves cached responses in <10ms'
    it 'reduces database queries by 80%'
  end
end
```

### Phase 9: System Testing (Week 8)

#### 9.1 End-to-End Testing

```ruby
# spec/system/user_journey_spec.rb
RSpec.describe "Complete User Journey", type: :system do
  it "allows users to search, view, and book properties" do
    # Test complete flow with Capybara
    visit root_path
    fill_in "Location", with: "San Francisco"
    click_button "Search"

    expect(page).to have_content("AI Recommended")

    click_link "View Property"
    click_button "Book Now"

    # Test Solid Queue job processing
    expect(EmailNotificationJob).to have_been_enqueued

    # Test Solid Cable real-time updates
    expect(page).to have_content("Booking Confirmed")
  end
end
```

### Phase 10: Security & Compliance with TDD (Week 9)

#### 10.1 Security Testing

```ruby
# spec/security/authentication_spec.rb
RSpec.describe "Authentication Security" do
  it "prevents session fixation"
  it "implements CSRF protection"
  it "rate limits login attempts"
  it "logs security events for audit"
end

# spec/policies/property_policy_spec.rb
RSpec.describe PropertyPolicy do
  subject { described_class.new(user, property) }

  context "as tenant" do
    it { should permit(:show) }
    it { should_not permit(:edit) }
  end

  context "as landlord" do
    it { should permit(:edit) }
    it { should permit(:destroy) }
  end
end
```
